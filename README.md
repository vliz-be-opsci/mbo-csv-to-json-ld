# Experimental CSV-W representation of data for MBO

## Prerequisites

N.B. This requires that the build system has [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

## Data CSVs

For editing by users (except for maybe the eov.csv table):

* [dataset.csv](./dataset.csv)
* [dataset-comment.csv](./dataset-comment.csv)
* [variable-measured.csv](./variable-measured.csv)
... and a number of others.

End-users would ignore (or perhaps not see) all of the other files which arecurrently stored in [remote](./remote/). But they're necessary for validating the data and converting it to an RDF representation.

## Before doing anything

Make sure you run the `init` command so that it can create the right output directories as well as pulling the required docker containers.

```bash
$ make init
```

## Validating the data

```bash
$ make validate
=============================== Pulling latest required docker images. ===============================
...

=============================== Validating remote/dataset-metadata.json ===============================
Valid CSV-W

=============================== Validating remote/eov-metadata.json ===============================
Valid CSV-W
```

It will (hopefully) tell you if you get something wrong, for instance referencing an EOV which isn't defined.

## Generating schema.org JSON-LD representation

```bash
$ make
....
```

### Speed build

If you want speedy outputs, have multiple cores at your disposal, and don't mind incoherently timed log outputs then consider running make with a degree of parallelism (`p`): 

```bash
$ p=4 && make -j "$p" init && make -j "$p" validate jsonld
```

Files are output in the `out` directory.

Example dataset output: 

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@import": "https://schema.org/",
    "schema": "https://schema.org/"
  },

## <https://w3id.org/marco-bolo/ConvertMboIdToNode>

This is an identifier which is used in CSV-W metadata documents and is necessary due to limitations in the CSV on the web standard. The CSV-W standard supports delimited list columns, however only supports the serialisation of these to RDF literals and does not allow them to point to RDF Nodes. As a result, we use <https://w3id.org/marco-bolo/ConvertMboIdToNode> as the datatype in the CSV-W and later convert all of these literals into resource/node references in the build process. This process also sticks `https://w3id.org/marco-bolo/` on front of the value in the column.

N.B. <https://w3id.org/marco-bolo/ConvertIriToNode> provides a similar function but more generally for IRIs.

## <https://w3id.org/marco-bolo/InputMetadataDescription>

This is an identifier which is used to internally track the parametadata describing who input the metadata about something, when it was done, etc. It is helpful since some of the metadata which helps distinguish para-metadata from the more practical metadata we're describing here.
