Therefore MBO aims to deliver a globally relevant freshwater and marine biodiversity Data Management Plan defined with a Community of Practice of stakeholders from different sectors (industry, policy, research, society) and from different ends of the data pathway (data collector to data end-users). MBO co-design Data Management Plans (D1.1 and D1.2) are deliverables due at 24 and 36 month of the project. The present first iteration of the Data Management Plan is only an overview of MBO principles about freshwater and marine biodiversity data that will be refined and detailed in D1.1 and D1.2. The DMP is a live document that will be reviewed and updated periodically.",,data management plan|biodiversity data|essential ocean variables|Horizon Europe|Global Ocean Observing System|United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development,en,,,,,mbo_audience_mbo,,,,mbo_org_mbo_wp1,mbo_zenodo,mbo_pub_status_published,2023-08-02,2024-07-01,2023-08-02,,mbo_license_ccby40,,,https://zenodo.org/records/8208410,v1.0.0,https://zenodo.org/records/8208410

In task 2.2, these objectives were met by exploration and comparison of databases, software and bioinformatic pipelines, aiming to facilitate the implementation of eDNA-based monitoring. Under this task, we reviewed the literature and here provide a comprehensive overview of widely used primer sets for eDNA metabarcoding, pipelines run for different marker genes, and reference databases used to assign taxonomy. Next, we conducted a comparison of bioinformatic pipelines for two types of metabarcoding data (18S and 12S), inviting people around the world to contribute results from running their respective pipelines on the same dataset(s).",,en,,,,,mbo_audience_mbo,,,,mbo_madsrj,,,,,,2025-11-31,mbo_license_cc0,,,,,
