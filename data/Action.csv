In task 2.2, these objectives were met by exploration and comparison of databases, software and bioinformatic pipelines, aiming to facilitate the implementation of eDNA-based monitoring. Under this task, we reviewed the literature and here provide a comprehensive overview of widely used primer sets for eDNA metabarcoding, pipelines run for different marker genes, and reference databases used to assign taxonomy. Next, we conducted a comparison of bioinformatic pipelines for two types of metabarcoding data (18S and 12S), inviting people around the world to contribute results from running their respective pipelines on the same dataset(s).",,mbo_org_mbo_wp2,,,

These data will contribute to the blueprint for the integration of multiple environmental and biodiversity sensors on fixed and mobile observatories to understand biodiversity change over time and space. The fixed platform will combine acoustic (hydrophones, echo-sounders, telemetry), imaging (in-situ microscopy) and eDNA sampling tools on a single frame to detect micro to macro-organisms.",,mbo_58452|mbo_edebusschere,,,mbo_task_4_4_seatrial_fpod|mbo_task_4_4_seatrial_echosounder|mbo_task_4_4_seatrial_hydrophone
