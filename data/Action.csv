In task 2.2, these objectives were met by exploration and comparison of databases, software and bioinformatic pipelines, aiming to facilitate the implementation of eDNA-based monitoring. Under this task, we reviewed the literature and here provide a comprehensive overview of widely used primer sets for eDNA metabarcoding, pipelines run for different marker genes, and reference databases used to assign taxonomy. Next, we conducted a comparison of bioinformatic pipelines for two types of metabarcoding data (18S and 12S), inviting people around the world to contribute results from running their respective pipelines on the same dataset(s).",,mbo_org_mbo_wp2,,mbo_wp2_d2_ds1|mbo_wp2_d2_ds2|mbo_wp2_d2_ds3|mbo_wp2_d2_ds4|mbo_wp2_d2_ds5|mbo_wp2_d2_ds6|mbo_wp2_d2_ds7,
